# Real-TC-Engine 

Real-TC-Engine is a physics engine to render the tropical cyclone based on Material Point Method. 
The Atmospheric renderer is based on Lagrangian partical tracing method to produce visualization of the TC related wind field.
The Wave renderer uses finite element simulation based on Eulerian method to construct the rough sea surface.
The Ocean renderer is based on Lagrangian partical tracing method to exhibite the TC coused oceanic currents.
